# CrystalBalls

> Crystal as in lattice, balls because I initially intend to only calculate glueball spectra: CrystalBalls.

This is a package for doing (presumably only very, very simple) lattice gauge theory computations.  My initial intentions are to do some toy calculations in
pure gauge and theories with only squarks, as fermions are a tremendous pain-in-the-ass and lattice computations without them are really surprisingly simple.

Ideally I'd like to write some really beautifully Julian code here, but my first attempt will probably be mainly practical.

This is a side-project being done in my free time and I may or may not decide to actually work on it.

My primary references have been [this nice primer](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/0012005) and these straightforward and accessible [lecture
notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3403).  Peter LePage's [tutorial](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/0506036) contains some practical advice on doing lattice
calculations for pure gauge theories and is also a useful reference for numerical computation of functional integrals in quantum theories more generally.
